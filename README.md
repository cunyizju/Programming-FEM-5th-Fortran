# Programming the finite element method_5th edition  
## Overview  
As a fan of finite element method (FEM), I has been appealed by the classic textbook - [Programming the finite element method](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Finite-Element-Method-Smith/dp/1119973341) for more than five years. When I was a bachelor, my supervisor Prof. Shang guided me to understand the theory of finite element method using coding. It was really impressive. Recently, I realize that it may be meaningful to reconstruct the code using [Microsoft Visual Studio 2012](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/zh-hans/vs/older-downloads/?rr=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) and [Intel Visual Fortran Composer XE 2013](https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-software-development-products-download-registration-licensing), making it convenient for debuging and second development.  

I once used Microsoft Windowing Application to present the modelling results. However, the Graphical User Interface (GUI) is not satisfactory. In this repository, I do not pay attention to visualization. What I focus on are the input and output files,  algorithms, and the readibility of the code. [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/) or [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) may be used for visualization in the future.
